# Open-Project.ps1 -- Open a recent project from the TIA Portal start screen  (skill step 2)
# Assumes TIA Portal just started and shows the Portal "Open existing project" page
# (i.e. right after Start-Tia.ps1).
#
# This script does only the DETERMINISTIC part (double-click the recent row) and then
# captures the screen. The conditional / timing-sensitive parts are handled by the
# calling procedure (SKILL.md) with capture-verify, because a blind timed click on the
# HSP dialog proved unreliable:
#   * If an "Open project: optional products are missing" (HSP) dialog appears,
#     click its green "Open" button at ~(1125, 672).
#   * After it loads, if the Portal "First steps" page shows, click "Project view"
#     at ~(60, 1016) to switch to the detailed view.
#   * Verify the project tree shows the PLC (not just Online access / Card Reader).
#
# Tip: opening via the Project menu's recent list (only available once in Project view)
#      jumps straight to Project view and skips the "Project view" click.
#
# Coordinates are for a maximized 1920x1080 window (verify with Capture-Screen -Grid).
# Usage: powershell -File Open-Project.ps1 [-RecentIndex 1] [-Grid]
# ASCII-only on purpose (PowerShell 5.1 / code page safety).
